The purpose of the review is to examine the challenges of critically injured patients with co-existing or secondary hypothermia and the research published in the past decade addressing these issues.  Using the search terms ‘trauma’ and ‘hypothermia,’ computerized searches of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Pre-MEDLINE databases were conducted.  The primary research concerning hypothermia in trauma patients was organized into three general categories for the purpose of analysis: 1) Incidence, 2) Pathology, 3) Prevention and Treatment.  The body of evidence is lacking in three main areas: 1) sample size, location, and continuity of care; 2) variability of injury severity and measurement; and 3) temperature measurement variations.  Future research should focused on hypothermia during trauma resuscitation and nurses’ roles in initial recognition and treatment.  The nursing literature must be updated to reflect the clinical research understanding of pathology and recommendations for practice.
